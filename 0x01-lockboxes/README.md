Lockboxes Implementation:
---------------------------------------------------
def canUnlockAll(boxes):

This line defines a function named canUnlockAll that takes a list of boxes as its parameter.
""" Method that determines if all boxes can be opened """

This is a docstring, providing a brief description of the function's purpose.
for key in range(1, len(boxes)):

This loop iterates over each key from 1 to the number of boxes. The assumption is that box 0 is always open.
flag = False

This line initializes a flag to track whether the current key can unlock any box.
for box in range(len(boxes)):

This loop iterates over each box.
if key in boxes[box] and box != key:

This condition checks if the key is in the list of keys for the current box and ensures that the box is not the same as the key.
flag = True

If the condition is met, the flag is set to True, indicating that the key can unlock at least one box.
break

The break statement is used to exit the inner loop since we found a box that the current key can unlock.
if not flag:

After the inner loop, if the flag is still False, it means the current key cannot unlock any box. In this case, the function returns False.
return True

If all keys can unlock at least one box, the function returns True.
This function checks if each key (starting from key 1) can unlock at least one box. If any key fails to unlock any box, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that all boxes can be opened.
